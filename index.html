Research has shown that Black and Hispanic individuals are more likely than White people with similar criminal histories and charges to be arrested and held in jail before trial and that they tend to have higher bails set and receive lengthier and more punitive sanctions, such as incarceration rather than probation.

<div class="textcontainer1-1">
But why? Well, it's all a matter of mind.

</div>

<div class="textcontainer1-2">
Segregation and “redlining” have effectively isolated Black people in underinvested areas and contributed to structural disadvantages, including concentrated poverty and poor outcomes in education, nutrition, mental and physical health, and employment. These conditions have been associated with heightened levels of crime, law enforcement surveillance, arrests, and even likelihood of behavioral health disorders, like substance misuse and mental illness; data shows that people with behavioral health disorders are overrepresented in arrests and jail admissions. And because of persistent discrimination in and inequitable access to health care, Black people are less likely than other racial groups to receive behavioral health care, which may influence the likelihood of diagnosis and treatment, possibly contributing to higher rates of associated arrests and jail admissions.

<div class="textcontainer1-3">
Although research has indicated some variations in offending patterns between people of different races and ethnicities, those inconsistencies do not completely account for the disparities observed in jails and throughout the criminal legal system, including in arrests and incarceration.

All the data provided leads into our final and most important point. Departmental
training should be a fluid concept, meaning that it should adapt to the times, change with laws
and regulations, and updated regularly. A training program is not set in stone. Constant training
will improve officer conduct but also greatly develop their interpersonal skills throughout the
department by improving competence, communications, and confidence. The idea focuses on
moving the department forward with a foundation of loyalties in its staff and officers. The
officers, through training and education, will see that their department is concerned about their
future and taking appropriate measures to mitigate workplace problems while on duty. Defunding the police will not combat police brutality. Instead we should opt to support more intensive and constant training programs for our men and women in blue. A program similar to an ethnic studies course would be amazing for them.</div>
